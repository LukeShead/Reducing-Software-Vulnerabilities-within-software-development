# 1.0 Reducing-Software-Vulnerabilities-within-software-development

## 1.1 Software development vulnerabilities and how to reduce them within the game

### 1.2 Introduction
When developing software, there are many ways that it can be exploited by attackers, this can be done in many ways however the biggest way is by discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within the system, this is because it is where the software is easier to exploit. 

#### 1.3 SQL injections and input areas.
For example, one of the most common vulnerabilities come from user inputs, this is where the user of a system can use an input to command the software to do things that could be considered malicious such as deleting information and data stored upon the system or being able to retreive the information in order to gain profit from them. These usually will come with softwares that have a database built into them, these are known as SQL injections, these can be very dangerous for a company or team that allow this type of vulnerability to be exploited as it can lead to the DPA (Data Protection Act) being broken and the team facing a penalty for it, this can mean losing thousands of pounds in fines. This is why this type of vulnerability can be so dangerous as it is extremely easy for it to be exploited due to it being given to the user, unlike other exploits, this only requires a simple line of code to begin the exploit.

#### 1.4 System limits and memory usage.
Unlike SQL injections with database input vulnerabilities, there are many different forms of vulnerabilities that can be exploited without the situational database. For example one vulnerability that is commmonly used is the amount of memory that a system can handle, every system has an amount of memory that they can use in order to complete the tasks, this means that the system can run out of memory and crash if a task that is too big for it is attempted. This is something that can be exploited on almost any system if given the opportunity, it can be something simple from a home PC to a company system. The ways to reduce this vulnerability require a lot of areas to be covered which means it is not as easy to reduce, however it is not a vulnerability that can be used to completly delete or destroy a system, the most it can do is hinder or stop a system temporarily. Because of this it is not a vulnerability that is very dangerous however it can lead to other exploits due to its ability to stop systems.

#### 1.5 Social engineering.
With many exploits being within the system or software, one of the most common ways a person will try to expose a system or software is with a technique called social engineering, this is the act of when a person will not find a vulnerability within the system but use another person to make a mistake and allow them access to the system. This is the reason no system is 100% safe, as people can always make mistakes whereas systems can only do what they are told, companies will always advise their employees to be cautious when handling sensitive information. Even though it is advised against, some people will still make mistakes as it is impossible to never make mistakes, this can come by clicking on an email that is false, or by using a USB that they found outside to see what is on it, this can cause a massive breach within the system and the company that owns it.

## 2.0 Ways to help reduce vulnerabilities and increase security on a system or software

### 2.1 The affects of having vulnerabilities exploited.
Those are just two of the many vulnerabilities that can mean that a software can be hindered from completing its purpose, many large companies and businesses have fallen victim from hackers exposing and exploiting vulnerabilities within their system, this breaches the Data Protection Act (DPA) which have lead to fines from around £500,000 which can be crippiling to some companies. In order to reduce these vunlerabilities, some companies will make sure that certain parts of the software is covered by making sure the developers add certain security measures in order to stop these vulnerabilities from being exploited. This is extremely important for all companies to have as they do not want to lose money and reputation by having their system breached.

### 2.2 Limiting characters.
When looking at the common user inputs vulnerability, companies cannot control people from attempting to enter malicous code into the database, however most databases will be made with the user inputs controlled. For example the simple way to reduce vulnerabilities is to have a limit on the amount of characters allowed on the input area, this can stop long lines of code from doing a lot of damage, however this is not certain to stop people doing damage. 

Another way that developers reduce the vulnerabilites within the input is situational depending on the type of input area, it is the measure of only allowing a certain type of characters in the area or just blocking out a specific type of characters. This can stop many different types of attacks, however as said before it is very situational, this is because sometimes an area may have the need to use different characters, for example an address area would require numbers and letters so they cannot be blocked.

Other than this many companies will set up backups for the database as well as encryptions to make sure that no-one can get completely destroy a system, with this it means that if someone wanted to delete the database's data, they would be able to retrieve it. However this will not stop people from attempting to steal the information, this is why many companies will encrypt the information within the database in order to not allow any malicous hackers to get the information if they do steal it. And if they do it may be a longer time before they can retrieve any information from it, this may be anough time to find the people and get the data back before any damage is done.

### 2.3 Keeping employees safe.
As there are many employees that work for a company, there are many oppurtunities to exploit a company using social engineering, people can use emails, skype messages and even through physical forms such as impersonating people within the company to gain access to higher information. 

#### 2.4 Personal Emails
In order to keep these kind of things from happening, companies will ensure measures such as having personal work emails that can only be accessed when the employees are in the workplace, this method stops any unwanted mail coming into the workplace that could be in some way malicous. This can keep away all types of attacks that requires a file to be sent by email, this means that in order to have these attacks on the company, an attacker must find out the email first before sending it, this is much more work for the attacker.

#### 2.5 Entrance Requirements
As well as the emails, there are many companies that to stop fraud in the company, will use a method of using some form of verification system when entering or exiting the company, for example a code that an employee is given when joining the company that allows them to clock in and clock out when entering and leaving the workplace or fingerprints with each employee. This method stops any type of physical entrance or fraud from someone with malicous intent, however again these methods can be worked around but doing so will be another big problem for malicous attackers to solve before they can access a system.

#### 2.6 Company Equipment
This is where companies will give their employees equipment to use in work and only for work, these can be laptops, phones or storage devices such as USB's or external hard drive. This is to ensure that their employees will not use any type of device that is bought or found outside the workplace, many attackers will try to use USB's with malicous software on them to lure people to giving access to the system. This can happen by leaving or dropping USB's outside a workplace in an attempt to lure someone to take one and plug it in on their work system, the USB's will usually have some form of malicous software that will give access to the attacker with the USB being connected to a workplace system.

#### 2.7 System analysis
This is one of the more technical methods, this is where a company will use this technique to analyse and check it all for problems, this method allows for comprehensive feedback as the system analysis will be used all over the system, all parts of it will be checked and tested to make sure they is not a vulnerability within the system. Because of the importance of the research, it means that sometimes there will be a third party team involved. This can come in many forms, one of which is the use of white hat hackers, these are hackers that work under the law and will hack systems in order to test for any vulnerabilites within the system, by having a white hat hack a system and give the feedback, it allows for all aspects of the system to be covered. 


## 3.0 Vulnerabilities within software development
What was went through within the introduction were the dangers and responses to certain vulnerabilities within a software or system, however it is during software development where a lot of vulnerabilities can be dangerous and can be exploited. 

References: http://www.veracode.com/sites/default/files/Resources/Whitepapers/how-vulnerabilities-get-into-software-veracode.pdf

### 3.1 Vulnerabilities examples.
With many different parts of the system being vulnerable during development, these being exploited can mean a lot of the work that has been done can be lost or corrupted. Here are some examples of vulnerabilities within software development:

#### 3.2 Re-usable code.
Many companies when looking at projects, in order to save time they will look at different points within the project that can be done by using recyclable code from past projects or being able to use free, re-usable code that free lancers will give to companies from websites that they can upload to. Doing this can save companies a lot of time and money, however it can mean that a company can also be vulnerable, many of the freelance code can have viruses or some form of malicous software hidden inside it. Many companies know this and will still take the risk of attempting to use the code, this is because if it doesn't and can have a positive affect on the project, it will save the team and the project a big tasks in creating the algorithym themselves.

#### 3.3 Coding languages and the idiosyncrasies within them
When building an application, the team will all meet to plan the project, when they doing this they will designate a coding language to be used in order to build the application, this can be any language as every language has a use that can be more helpful for a certain type of application, because of this it means that there will be a some things that this code will be very good at. However some codes have idiosyncrasies, this means it has an unusual behaviour, for example web scripting languages were more vulnerable to attacks such as SQL injections because of how it interacts with the code.

## 4.0 Case Studies.

There are many examples when looking at software development vulnerabilities, this can be seen when looking at case studies about software development vulnerability. By looking at these case studies it should give enough information on the topic of software vulnerability in the professional standard.

### 4.1 Case Study No.1 (Yahoo Hack 2016)

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/yahoo-hack-security-of-one-billion-accounts-breached

#### 4.2 What happened?
In 2016 the internationally known company Yahoo, was hacked, this was done by a group of people that had the goal of collecting personal data about the users that used the yahoo site in order to gain sensitive information about them all. This meant that when the hack was successful it impacted the company by a large margin as the DPA (Data Protection Act) was breached a large number of times. Because of this the company was forced to sell it's core businees to Verizon as their stocks dropped by such a considerable rate that they had no choice but to sell. The information they stole included telephone numbers, passwords and email addresses, this is all sensitive information that breaches the DPA.

#### 4.3 How was it done?
The hack was commenced by implementing fake cookies onto the website of Yahoo, user's that would enter the site would see the cookies appear on the screen, this would mean that when users would enable the fake cookies onto their system it would allow the malware to access their system and extract the information. This means that by not even realising, the user's of the site accepted the malware onto their system as they believed it was just harmless cookies. This technique was extremely successful and allowed around 3 billion user's information to be extracted and sold.

#### 4.4 How did they solve the problem?
Yahoo were unable to catch the hackers that were paid to hack them even when working with the police. Because of this they contacted every person that was affected by the hack and asked them to change their information within the account, whereas many people did this it still did not stop many customers being drawn away from Yahoo and closing down the account. There was no precautions taken for this kind of event, because of this it meant that many user's account information was taken and sold.


### 4.5 Case Study No.2(Ebay Hack 2014)

##### References: http://metro.co.uk/2014/05/22/the-ebay-hack-what-you-need-to-know-4736153/

#### 4.6 What happened?
In 2014 the company Ebay was hacked by a group that used its methods to gather encrypted passwords as well as other personal information,  there was no information released about when this attacked happened or how long it took for them to stop this event. This was another breach of the DPA, because of this EBay were fined five hundred pounds for this event. As well as this, many of EBay's customers had to change information on their account to ensure that their information was not still shown. However the most damaged thing was their reputation, EBay suffered from many people not trusting the site and shopping for items on other websites.

#### 4.7 How was it done?
The hackers used their methods to access the database that kept all of EBay's customer data on. They took the data that was stored on the database about all of their customers sensitive data in order to sell it to other people later on for profit. Access was gained throughh using three different coperate emails to find their way into the database. The people that had their emails stolen were higher ups within the company, this meant it gave them access to most of the system with hacking it.

#### 4.8 How did they solve the problem?
EBay sent out emails to all of the people that were affected by the hack, the people that had their emails taken were advised to change their passwords and even the whole emails of the account. The emails had a problem being sent out, the amount of people that had information stolen was above the thousands, this meant sending that many emails out in a short amount of time very difficult. Because of this there were many people that didn't get their notification email till much later after the hack was released, this damaged the reputation as there were people that didn't know their information was stolen.


## 5.0 Primary Research

When researching for reducing vulnerabilities within developing software, I needed to use many different techniques and tools in order to research correctly, this includes different PDF's being read and notes taken from those, also having my own primary research being done to get the research. All of this was to understand three different question that I wanted to ask, these questions are:

1. Are people aware of what hacking is and how it is done?

2. How safe do people think they are with their current security settings?

3. Do people know what kind of data could lead to breaches in personal information if collected?

The reasons why I want to know about these questions is because by looking at how people view security and how safe they think they are could link into when developing software, this is because if people are not careful during their development stage they can allow important data or information to be leaked out. Having data leaks can cause many different issues when attempting to develop a software as the software will be comprimised and any plans along with it, this can be potentially fatal for a company if the development of the software is vital for a team to keep operating

By finding out different ways people believe that hacking is and how they believe it is done, it shows me what kind of methods they know how to defend against since they are aware of it. For example if someone knows phishing is a method of hacking and what it does, the person can then look out for it and have measures to counter it, this means that they will be safer as they will have methods of preventing phishing from affecting them, meaning they have reduced the vulnerabilities within the development software.

Finally, people that may not know the difference between sensitive and non-sensitive information can be at risk of allowing someone access into their personal information if they are not careful. If people know what is the difference and what information is classed as 'sensitive' and what isn't, then they can be more careful when dealing with this information and because of this, can be able to prevent certain information being accessed and by doing this, that person can keep themselves safer when handling delecate information, and as of such not allow breaches within their software.

### 5.1 Questionnaire that I used

I used many methods in order to research different techniques that can be used and how well it is understood in the view of the general public, one method I used in order to gather primary research was a questionnaire, this questionnaire would help me get answers to how people view cyber security and how safe people beleive their life is online. 

Using this information I will be able to see about how people view cyber security and the risks of not knowing how safe they are or are not. This will allow me to look at peoples knowledge on security therefore their knowledge on keeping themselves safe when doing anything online, this includes software development. The results will show if people know how to protect themselves when building software, the questionnaire focused on how people view security and how dangerous it can be to not know enough, by finding out general security knowledge, we can look at knowledge of security of developing software.

### 5.2 The information gathered when analysing my research

#### Are people aware of what hacking is and how it is done?
The first question that I wanted to answer was how aware are people of hacking and how it is done, this includes the danger that it has onto someone and what it can mean if it is successful in it's task. Because of this the first question in my questionnaire was simply asking whether the person had ever experienced a hack of any type before, whilst going through the answers all the results started showing how different answers were for people that have experienced hacks and people that haven't. To further answer this question and find the information, the next question asked about the views on cyber security and whether it is important to know about it, this question would show how people see cyber security as being important to know and learn about, or if they believed it wasn't. 
The results in the questionnaire showed that there was a clear difference in how people viewed cyber security after experiencing a hack and how people viewed it after never experiencing a hack. 

The answers for the second question were highers numbers eg. 10 or 7, this was for all people that had experienced a type of hack in their lifetime, however the other people that rated cyber security importance rated it quite low, there were a few people that had a low score, when looking at this, these people had not experienced any form of hack in their lifetime, this shows how people that know the dangers of cyber security and have experienced it understands how important cyber security is for people. However, people that have not seen the dangers of a hack or just haven't experienced it themselves feel that knowing about cyber security isn't that important. This can be dangerous for people to underestimate the importance of cyber security and the dangers that it can have as if someone is not aware of what can happen if they allow a breach of their private information on the internet.

When asking about the types of malicous malware that can be used to damage a system, I gave one example which was Trojan Horse, with this people that wrote down types of malicous malware that they knew, the most common ones that appeared were Worm, Phishing and Trojan Horse. These types of malware are more common and well known that others, as well as this people mentioned Brute Force and one person mentioned RUDY (R.U.Dead.Yet) malware. The malware that were mentioned on this questionnaire where all very similar, all of them had a basic understanding of malware. This shows that people are aware of certain malware that can be used to damage a computer and as of such, can use this knowledge to help prevent any attacks.

As well as this the questionnaire asked about malware within a system and how it will be able to damage it if it was successful with a breach, The answers of this were very similar in that they all involved file corruption or deleting files, some people wrote about files being destroyed however each one was a little bit different, some people said about being corrupted and being lost, others just said damaging the computer, it wasn't very descriptive on how it would happen. This shows that people know the dangers of malware and what they can do however lack certain knowledge, for example what certain malware does and therefore how to stop it.

When looking at the questionnaire for the research project, there were many conclusions that could of been drawn from it, for example when looking at certain parts of the questionnaire we can see that people that hadn't experienced a cerain type of hack in their life had not been too bothered about the state of cyber security within their life and within their life on the internet.

#### How safe do people think they are with their current security settings?
The next questions that I wanted to have answered was how safe do people think they are with their current security settings? This is the question designed to see peoples knowledge on their own security and how much they believe they are doing to protect themselves, for this I asked a few different questions that will see how safe they believe the are and then testing them on what they think safe is. 

The first question I asked to help solve this was having a quantatative answer onto how safe people thought they were, I asked them to rate their different passwords and how safe and unique their passwords are. These answers seemed to show how people with more experience in hacks viewed their passwords in comparison to people that haven't seem to be similar, people most of the time believed that their security in their passwords was secure.  

For people who are mostly very confident in their password strength, they should be able to identify what passwords are safe and what are not when given examples. Because of this my next question was a test to see if these people knew what made a password safe was, I gave 2 examples, one was shorter but had a mixter of numbers and letters, and the other was long but had the same letters and no variety in characters. The correct answer to this was the longer but simpler one, this is because most systems are designed to only look for short but complex characters rather than longer ones depsite them being simpler.

Despite people believing that they know what makes a password safe, many people that had said their password security was high also answered incorrectly to this question, many people said B because of how unique it was in comparison to A, out of the 20 people that took the questonnaire, 11 people that rated their security high answered wrong. This shows that people who believe that their security on their passwords was high actually might have the wrong idea on what makes a password safe, this misconception can lead to security breaches as malicous software that is used to break passwords will be able to complete it's function much faster and will have a higher success rate allowing for more breaches and more information that can potentially be stolen.

The third question that I wanted to answer is if people know was do people know what kind of data could lead to breaches in personal information if collected? This question was to determine whether people are letting information that could be used against them in the future, for example their date of birth or their place of work. Information that can be used against you is called sensitive information, this means that by someone retrieving it, if used the right way, it can have a negative affect on the person that gave it out. If it isn't sensitive information then it is called non-sensitive information, this can be your name or country you live in. 

I tested people that took the questionnaire about this topic by asking them on if they believed they knew what information was considered sensitive and non-sensitive and then giving them examples to try and put into the two catagories. Out of the 20 people that took the questionnaire only three people said they didn't know the difference, the rest apparently knew what the difference was and what kind of information could be. However, when giving examples, every single example was a piece of sensitive information, the reason for this was to allow the reader to think about all of them and see if they can tell that they were all sensitive and if not, what was their definition on sensitive information.

Out of the 17 people that said they knew what sensitive and non-sensitive information is, only two did not tick any, the remaining 15 people ticked something in the boxes, this meant that the people that thought they had an idea on what sensitive and non-sensitive information was actually did not understand how important certain pieces of information is. The most common was passwords for identifying non-sensitive information, this is because people understand what danger it can be to their life if your passwords are given to someone they don't know. However the most ticked answer was age, this is because the people taking the questionnaire do not understand the danger of someone having your age or what it can lead to. 

### Drawing meaningful conclusions from the research

By looking at all the information that has been researched, the biggest problem that has been researched by me has been the lack of knowledge that people have when keeping security in their daily life, for example when people are choosing passwords for their online accounts or for any private use, make sure people understand what makes a password safe rather than what is known as common misconception to be the uniqueness of the password when it can be as simple as increasing the number of characters in a password. 

That was the main goal for my primary research, however my secondary research was to look at different types of hacks and how they affected companies and the drawbacks of being hacked as well as measures that were taken to stop it from happening again, by looking at these different points I could find out how when dealing with software there are many vulnerabilities but also many ways to reduce them.

#### Solutions

##### Primary Research
The first solutionI would recommend when referencing software development is to be able to understand what It means to have safe security settings, what this means is that different parts of the software development can be primarily online, this can be saving to the cloud or sending emails, as well as this if developers are not in the same area then there will be the need for many file transfers between them, this can mean that their project can be stolen or leaked before release.

This would mean understanding what makes a computer safe and allow those safety protocols to be practised within the development process, by doing this being able to keep data safe from external sources, this doesn’t mean that it is the only thing that can be done however, most hacks and cyber-attacks do not come from internal rather than simple malicious tactics instead of a hack.

The questions that I asked can all be summed up into general knowledge onto security measures and the common misconceptions that exist within the area, for my primary research it was all about the knowledge and how it would affect people that don’t understand what makes their computer safe. To this end, the answers that I found were mostly leaning towards believing to know what made certain security measures safe however actually not, this shows a clear lack of knowledge within young people today. 

##### Secondary Research
When looking at the secondary research and the case studies that was taken, there are many different types of vulnerabilities within a system and how the vulnerabilities can be exploited for malicious intent. Earlier in the document I explained how different forms of vulnerabilities can exist within a system and the problems they can cause. An example of this is System limits and memory usage, I explained how it can be exploited to crash a software, this can lead into many different events that can cause a company to have a massive data breach and potentially cause damage to the company’s reputation or projects.



## Conclusion
In conclusion, by using different types of researching methods, I have been able to get an idea about vulnerabilities that can exist on a system and especially in daily life, these can be extremely dangerous and can be fatal to certain projects. I mainly looked at the lack of knowledge in daily life when doing my primary research, these were to answer questions that would help find ways in reducing vulnerabilities when designing software.

By looking at the general understanding of people, I am able to understand the type of knowledge people have and how they can be very dangerous to not understand and know. The biggest points of the research was looking at the same types of information that are very common, for example if people are not aware of the dangers of giving away certain information to people then they can be in danger of giving away information that can cause a lot of damage to them either online or in real life.

As well as this companies that build software have many vulnerabilities that must be covered before allowing access to the public, the vulnerabilities can cause a problem that is trivial, or a problem that can be fatal. Because of this no matter what the vulnerability is and how hard it is to exploit, they must be covered and as many as possible without affecting limitations. By not doing this, it means that the project and software that is being developed can be at risk of being exploited when it is complete.
